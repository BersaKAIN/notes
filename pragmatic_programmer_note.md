## Always love and care about your project.

This one should be especially true for me. Whenever I feel the project is useless or not even that case, just feeling some negative aspects of the project, either some part is really hard to handle or there is less focus on it or it becomes tedious on some part of it, I became discouraged and stopped putting 100% onto the project. This will never let the project happen.

Think about of the project, always make sure you are energetic before you go in.

## Kaizen

Kaizen is the Japanese term for continuously making small improvements. This is very crucial to software engineering as well as to self development. Not only make improvement, but also make some EVERY DAY. Make sure after every day you are better programmer.


## 

The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak. 
-- J. B. Bossuet

## Take Responesbility

Error occurs and you are the one to blame.

Don't accuse others or blame situations or tools. That would make you look lame. 
The only thing you should think about is to fix the issue. What options do you have, what are the possible results.

## Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

Perple are more willing to join ongoing success than risky startups. So some time you should just bring some stones and ask for the other ingredients.

## Broken Window

If some project has some crappy code in it, then the others wouldn't pay much attention maintaining it well. So don't be the first one to wrtie bad code and put out fire (bad code) as soon as you find it.

## Managing Your Knowledge Portfolio

### Invest Constantly

- Learn at least one new language every year.
- Read a tech book each quarter.
- Read non tech books too.
- Take classes (one each month)

### Opportunities of Learning

You have come along many problems you feel hard to solve. Don't let it go or stop there. Ask people who know it. This is one way of building personal relationships. Also, be sure you don't ask too much like you did in salesforce or don't only ask but not doing your own practice.

At the same time, don't let the time constraint or goals make you only skim through your materials. You better have full understanding of what you read and think critically about it.

About asking a guru:
- Be polite before and after you ask the question.
- Be specific about what you are asking.

## Communication

Have an outline of what you write for documentation or the important talks. Make sure you get across those topics.

Know your audience and prepare what they can understand and are interested in. That involves constantly analyzing people's needs and motives.

Choose the right moment of talking, always start by asking: "Is it a good time to talk about ...? "

Get back to people. If you want people to respond to your emails, you will have to respond to theirs in the first place.



Buy low and sell high: This means learn some technolodge before it gets popular. Which will involve constanting trying new things out and the instinct of seeing future trend.

# Pragmatic Approach

## Evils of Duplication
The program we write is a code representation of our knowledge of natural laws and customer requirement. We want to put a single piece of knowledge in a single, umambiguous place. We Don't Repeat Yourself. We want to avoid duplication. It might be easy when you are writing the code, but it will introduce more, much more, complexity when you are maintaining the code.

However, there are cases that duplication seem impossible to avoid.
- Imposed Duplicaiton: Duplications that are imposed by the system, using different languages. We can address this by using some form of metadata and take those metadata to generate code in different languages or in different layer of the system.

- Inadvertent Duplication: Duplication introduced by bad design.

- Impatienet Duplication: Duplication introduced by bad habits of programmer.

- Interdeveloper Duplication: Duplicaiton introduced by multiple programmers having their own implementation of the same knowledge.

## Orthogonality

When DRY means avoid duplication of knowledge in the code. Orthogonality means avoid dependency amongst different parts of code. Changing the internal behavior of some module should affect the others.

## Reversibility

Nothing is more dangerous than an idea if it's the only one you have.

-- Emil-Auguste Chartier, Propos sur la religion, 1938

very true for me, having an cool idea and walk around and sell the idea, but if that is the only thing you have, it's either easy to be copied or it's just idea without implementation.


Critical decisions in programming often involves drastic change either in the language/system/architecture/third-party software. Your responsibility is then to design the system to make the program robust in such situation.

COBRA: Common Object Request Broker Architecture, an architecture that enables pieces of programs, called objects, to communicate with one another regardless of what programming language they were written in or what operating system they're running on.
