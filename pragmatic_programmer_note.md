# Always love and care about your project.

This one should be especially true for me. Whenever I feel the project is useless or not even that case, just feeling some negative aspects of the project, either some part is really hard to handle or there is less focus on it or it becomes tedious on some part of it, I became discouraged and stopped putting 100% onto the project. This will never let the project happen.

Think about of the project, always make sure you are energetic before you go in.

# Kaizen

Kaizen is the Japanese term for continuously making small improvements. This is very crucial to software engineering as well as to self development. Not only make improvement, but also make some EVERY DAY. Make sure after every day you are better programmer.

The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.

# Take Responesbility

Error occurs and you are the one to blame.

Don't accuse others or blame situations or tools. That would make you look lame. 
The only thing you should think about is to fix the issue. What options do you have, what are the possible results.

# Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

Perple are more willing to join ongoing success than risky startups. So some time you should just bring some stones and ask for the other ingredients.

# Broken Window

If some project has some crappy code in it, then the others wouldn't pay much attention maintaining it well. So don't be the first one to wrtie bad code and put out fire (bad code) as soon as you find it.

# Managing Your Knowledge Portfolio

## Invest Constantly

- Learn at least one new language every year.
- Read a tech book each quarter.
- Read non tech books too.
- Take classes (one each month)

## Opportunities of Learning

You have come along many problems you feel hard to solve. Don't let it go or stop there. Ask people who know it. This is one way of building personal relationships. Also, be sure you don't ask too much like you did in salesforce or don't only ask but not doing your own practice.

At the same time, don't let the time constraint or goals make you only skim through your materials. You better have full understanding of what you read and think critically about it.

About asking a guru:
- Be polite before and after you ask the question.
- Be specific about what you are asking.

# Communication

Have an outline of what you write for documentation or the important talks. Make sure you get across those topics.

Know your audience and prepare what they can understand and are interested in. That involves constantly analyzing people's needs and motives.

Choose the right moment of talking, always start by asking: "Is it a good time to talk about ...? "



Buy low and sell high: This means learn some technolodge before it gets popular. Which will involve constanting trying new things out and the instinct of seeing future trend.
